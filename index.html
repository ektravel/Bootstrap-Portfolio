                        <p>Hello and welcome to my homepage! My name is Ekaterina but I go by Katya because, letâ€™s face it, not many people can pronounce
                        my full name. In April of 2018, I joined The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin in hopes of eventually developing a solid skillset 
                        to become a successful web developer. 
                        I was born in Khabarovsk which is the second largest city in the Russian Far East. As a college junior, I moved to Anchorage, 
                        Alaska where I graduated from the University of Alaska, Anchorage. A few years ago, my husband and I moved to Austin in search
                        of new adventures and city life. We both absolutely love it here!
                        </p>

                    <div class = "col-md-12">
                        <p>
                        My background is in Business Administration and Oil & Gas Procurement. I did not have any coding experience before joining the 
                        bootcamp; but I am confident that by the end of the program I will be ready to enter the workforce. I know it will be challenging 
                        and stressful at times but I am excited to learn and I cannot wait to start a new career as a full stack web developer.
